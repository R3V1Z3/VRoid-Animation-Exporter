# VRoid Animation Exporter
This is a relatively simple but highly specialized script for AutoHotkey that helps to automate exports of animations from VRoid Studio, ultimately for the purpose of using those exported frames to create a video.

The script basically just automates mouse clicks in VRoid Studio in order to export animation frames. The exported frames are saved sequentially so they can be dropped into any capable video editor (such as kdenlive) to automatically generate a video from the sequences.

For an example of one such video, see: https://pixabay.com/videos/anime-manga-cartoon-cute-smile-46447/

That video was made using this script and then dropping the exported frames into Kdenlive.
